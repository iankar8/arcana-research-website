Create a 1200x400px email header for "Unsent Drafts - A Private Newsletter From Ian Kar". 

**Style:** Clean, minimal, sophisticated with subtle tech elements. Think premium business newsletter, not gaming.

**Design:**
- Deep navy/dark blue gradient background (#0a0e27 to #1a1a2e) - very subtle, almost solid
- Simple line-art envelope icon in the left third - thin strokes, elegant, outlined in soft cyan (#00D9FF)
- Small, tasteful notification badge with "1" - minimal pink accent (#FF3B9A)
- "UNSENT DRAFTS" in clean, modern sans-serif font - thin weight, cyan color
- "A Private Newsletter From Ian Kar" in smaller, lighter gray text below (emphasize "Private" slightly)
- 3-5 small stars scattered subtly in background - very faint
- 2-3 short horizontal lines (motion streaks) on left side - subtle, not flashy
- Minimal glow effects - just enough to add depth, not neon

**Mood:** Professional, refined, understated elegance. Like a Financial Times or New Yorker aesthetic but with a subtle modern tech edge. Sophisticated minimalism for discerning readers. The word "Private" adds exclusivity.

**Avoid:** Bright neons, excessive glow, busy patterns, gaming aesthetics, anything flashy or loud.
