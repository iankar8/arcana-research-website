## When to Use Each

### Use Enhanced Versions When:
- You want maximum visual impact
- The logo will be displayed at medium to large sizes
- You're using it on digital platforms (web, email, social)
- You want to match the original cosmic/neon aesthetic
- Background color is dark or can accommodate the design

### Use Simple Versions When:
- You need a clean, minimal look
- The logo will be very small (< 100px)
- You're printing in black & white
- You need a transparent background with no effects
- File size is a critical concern
- You're overlaying on photos or complex backgrounds

## File Size Comparison

- **Enhanced versions:** ~15-25KB (includes filters and effects)
- **Simple versions:** ~2-5KB (minimal markup)

Both are SVG format, so they scale infinitely without quality loss.

## Color Variations

All versions use the same core colors:
- **Cyan:** #00D9FF
